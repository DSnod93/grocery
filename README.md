### 

Grocery consumption is the basic human need and in this time of pandemic, people are increasingly relying on online grocery shopping. Our goal is to be able to build a customer friendly grocery delivery application by applying all our learnings from UCB bootcamp. 

## Project Slogan

“Groceries for the changing world”

## Project UX Flowchart

## User Story

“As a customer, I want to filter for products, so that I can find the ones I want to buy.”

“As a customer, I want to authenticate myself so that I can see my account details and place orders.”

“As a customer, once I have placed my orders an email will be sent out to me as a confirmation” 

## Acceptance Criteria
